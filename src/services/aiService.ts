CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCURACY:
1. Age distribution MUST match the Census age groups data exactly
2. Racial/ethnic demographics MUST match the Census percentages
3. Education levels MUST reflect the actual Census education data
4. Income distribution MUST represent the FULL spectrum - from poverty level to high income
5. Occupations MUST be SPECIFIC job titles, NOT generic categories
6. Each constituent must have a UNIQUE personal story that fits their demographic profile AND explains how the specific policy proposal affects them personally
7. Each constituent MUST have exactly 3 political policies they support, based on their demographics, income, occupation, and personal circumstances

OCCUPATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Use SPECIFIC job titles (e.g., "Teacher", "Nurse", "Software Engineer", "Accountant", etc.)
- DO NOT use generic terms like "Management", "Service", "Professional", "Worker"
- Each occupation must be a specific, realistic job title

PERSONAL STORY REQUIREMENT:
- Each constituent's personal story must explain how the specific policy proposal affects them personally
- Consider their age, income, occupation, education, and family situation
- Explain both direct and indirect impacts on their daily life, finances, or future
- Make the impact specific to their circumstances, not generic statements

POLITICAL POLICIES REQUIREMENT:
- Each constituent MUST have exactly 3 political policies they support
- Each policy should be ONE CONCISE SENTENCE (e.g., "Universal healthcare access", "Increased funding for public education", "Tax credits for small businesses")
- Policies should reflect the constituent's demographic profile, income level, occupation, and personal circumstances
- Avoid generic or vague policies - be specific about what they support
- Consider how their background influences their political views
- Keep each policy short and clear - one sentence maximum
- CRITICAL: Each constituent's policies must be UNIQUE and different from other constituents
- Generate policies that make sense for their specific age, income, education, occupation, and background
- Examples of diverse policies to consider:
  * Healthcare: Universal healthcare access, Lower prescription drug costs, Mental health services funding
  * Education: Increased funding for public education, Student loan forgiveness, Vocational training programs
  * Economic: Tax credits for small businesses, Minimum wage increase, Job training programs
  * Housing: Affordable housing initiatives, Rent control measures, First-time homebuyer assistance

- Do NOT generate real names, fictional names, or any other naming format
- This is a strict requirement for privacy and consistency

INCOME DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
- If poverty rate is ${censusData.povertyRate || 'unknown'}%, then ${censusData.povertyRate || 0}% of constituents should have incomes below poverty level
- Income range should span from $15,000 (minimum wage) to $200,000+ (high income)
- Most constituents should cluster around the median income of $${censusData.medianIncome.toLocaleString()}
- Include representation of: minimum wage workers, service workers, middle class, professionals, and high earners

CENSUS DATA TO USE:
- Age Groups: ${censusData.ageGroups ? Object.entries(censusData.ageGroups).map(([range, count]) => `${range}: ${count} people`).join(', ') : 'Not available'}
- Demographics: ${Object.entries(censusData.demographics).map(([demo, pct]) => `${demo}: ${pct}%`).join(', ')}
