# Census API Setup Guide

## âœ… Successfully Using Free Census Bureau ACS API

Great news! We're now using the **free U.S. Census Bureau ACS (American Community Survey) API** which requires **no credentials or signup**.

### What We're Using
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.census.gov/data/2021/acs/acs5`
- **Data Source**: 2021 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates
- **Authentication**: None required - completely free and public
- **Rate Limits**: Generous limits for public use

### Data Available
- Total population by ZIP code
- Racial demographics (White, Black, Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander)
- Hispanic/Latino population
- Median household income
- Education levels (Bachelor's, Master's, Professional, Doctorate degrees)
- Geographic boundaries
- No personal information (aggregated data only)

### How It Works
The API returns data in this format:
```json
[
  ["B01003_001E", "B03002_003E", "B03002_004E", "B03002_005E", "B03002_006E", "B03002_007E", "B03002_012E", "B19013_001E", "zip code tabulation area"],
  ["26966", "14480", "2013", "18", "4527", "50", "4973", "101409", "10001"]
]
```

Where:
- `B01003_001E` = Total population
- `B03002_003E` = White alone
- `B03002_004E` = Black or African American alone
- `B03002_005E` = American Indian and Alaska Native alone
- `B03002_006E` = Asian alone
- `B03002_007E` = Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone
- `B03002_012E` = Hispanic or Latino
- `B19013_001E` = Median household income
